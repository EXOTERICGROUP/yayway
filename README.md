A video and photo theme for Telescope.

Install it with `meteor add telescope:zeiss`. 

Make sure to uninstall any other theme (with the exception of the `base` theme), with (for example) `meteor remove telescope:theme-hubble`.

Note that the theme currently requires running the `devel` branch of Telescope to work.
