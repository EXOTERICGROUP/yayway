A video and photo theme for Telescope.

Install it with `meteor add telescope:zeiss`. 

Make sure to uninstall any other theme (with the exception of the `base` theme), with (for example) `meteor remove telescope:theme-hubble`.

Note that the theme currently requires running the `devel` branch of Telescope to work. 

### Zeiss Tutorial

If you're interested in customizing the theme or making your own, you'll find a [detailed tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBoa_Q6hVeSzw6cGRaKInzNc3saxWcH4M) that takes you through each part of the theme.
